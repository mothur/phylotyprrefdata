Description: 
    A data package that provides users of the {phylotypr} package with the
    reference data needed to classify 16S rRNA gene sequences using the RDP's
    trainset19 taxonomy reference. The data were originally posted by the RDP 
    and reformatted for use with mothur. Both the "rdp" and "pds" versions of
    the trainset19 reference data are available as `trainset19_rdp` and 
    `trainset19_pds`, respectively.
